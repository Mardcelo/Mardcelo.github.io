This is what happens when you give a kid unrestricted internet access 

I do mathematics, and computer security

In this blog I share half of my knowledge. 

# So who am i? 

I have no answer about that, even I don't know who myself is. 
I am Security researcher that had alcoholic courage to start security from young age. 
This also mean I had to face bunch of hard times earlier than anyone. During these phase, 
I have suffered from mental illness, having Schizophernia and Depression. 

I'm currently working with Mardslab and also studying with some University labs
