# Friend Trends 

While reading a book/thesis by Brendan W. Sullivan and came across this math problem by Hungarian sociologist and his observations of circles of friends among children and it inspired me so this motivated me writing a blog post. 

## Problem Statement 

 > In the 1950s, a Hungarian sociologist S. Szalai studied friend relationship between children. He observed that in any group of around 20 children, he was able to find four children who were mutual friends, or four children such taht no two of them were friends. Before drawing any sociological conclusions, Szalai consulted three eminent 
 > mathematicians in Hungary at that time: Erdos, Turan and Sos. A brief discussion revealed that indeed this is a mathematical phenomenon rather than a sociological one. For any symmetric relation R on at least 18 elements, tehre is a subset S of 4 elements such that R contains either all pairs in S or none of them. This fact is a special case of 
 > Ramsey's theorem proved in 1930, the foundation of Ramset theory which developed later into a rich area of combinatorics.

The puzzle we now present follows the same idea but with some smaller numbers. Specifically, we are interested in investigating the smallest size of a group of people that necessitates a subgroup of three people that are all mutually friends or all mutually enemies
