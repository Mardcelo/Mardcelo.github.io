This is what happens when you give a kid unrestricted internet access 

I do mathematics, and computer security

In this blog I share half of my knowledge. 

# So who am i? 

I have no answer about that, even i don't know who myself is. 
I am Security researcher that had alcoholic courage to start Security from young age. 
This also mean I had to face bunch of hard times earlier than anyone probably. 
I almost had mental illness when I came to facing these problems but I somehow got rid of it by talking to people 

I'm currently working with Mardslab and also studying for some University labs
