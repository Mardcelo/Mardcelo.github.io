### Introduction

Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (MMM) is one of the important numerical kernel functionality, used in various places such areas as network, linear systems of equation, transformation of co-ordinate systems, and population modeling.  

### Equation 

Given a $k$ x $m$ matrix $A = [a_{i,j}]$ and an $m$ x $n$ matrix $B = [b_{i,j}]$ the product $C = AB$ is a $k$ x $m$ matrix with entries. 

So assume if you have 2 by 3, 3 by 2 matrices 


The end product should look like $C_{21}$ = $a_{21}\ b_{11}$ + $a_{22}\ b_{21}$ + $a_{23}\ b_{31}$  

$C_{21}$ the subscript 2 and 1 should represent i and j from the equation.
